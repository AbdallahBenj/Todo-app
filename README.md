# TODO Application with Local Storage - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this project, I built a TODO application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal is to explore the power of **local storage** in modern web applications and learn how to persist data across sessions.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Task Management Tool
- **Purpose**: Learn how to build interactive UIs while persisting user data in the browser.
- **Skills Learned**: Form handling, local storage API, DOM manipulation, CRUD operations, event listeners

## Features
- 📝 **Task Creation**: Add new tasks using a clean and intuitive form.
- 📦 **Local Storage Integration**: Automatically saves tasks to the browser so they remain after refresh or browser close.
